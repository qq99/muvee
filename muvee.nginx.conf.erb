# Graciously stolen from https://www.exratione.com/2014/03/running-nginx-as-a-non-root-user/
# and modified to work
#
# A very simple example configuration showing how to launch Nginx as a non-root
# user without sudo access.
#
# Adjust the paths and other settings for your specific circumstances. They are
# currently configured for transient usage - you'd want to pick more permanent
# locations in the filesystem if intending this to run for a while.
#
# Note that as Nginx is not launched as root, it cannot bind to privileged
# ports lower than 1024.
#
# Usage: nginx -c /path/to/this/file.conf
#

# This error log will be written regardless of server scope error_log
# definitions, so we have to set this here in the main scope.
#
# Even doing this, Nginx will still try to create the default error file, and
# log a non-fatal error when it fails. After that things will work, however.
error_log <%= @app_root %>/tmp/error.log;

# The pidfile will be written to /var/run unless this is set.
pid <%= @app_root %>/tmp/muvee.pid;
